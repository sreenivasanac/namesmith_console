Things to implement:
1.  Address the linter errors:
    - Create or import the Pagination component in src/app/dashboard/page.tsx.
    - Create the Select component in @/components/ui/select or import it from a UI library.
    - Update the where clause in src/lib/actions/fetch-domains.ts to match your Prisma schema.
    - Add type declarations for the global prisma object in src/lib/prisma.ts.
2. Complete the implementation of the dashboard and domain detail pages.
3. Set up your Supabase database and ensure your Prisma schema is correctly synced.
4. Implement the server actions for editing, deleting, buying, and reselling domains.
5. Add more detailed setup instructions to the README as you finalize your development environment.
6. Consider adding sections for "Contributing" and "License" to the README.
7. As you develop, keep updating the README to reflect any changes in setup procedures or new features.
